Start your command prompt. Get a paper and pen ready
Type print("hello"). Python executes this, which has the effect of printing the letters h-e-l-l-o. Notice that the quotation marks that you used to enclose the string are not part of the output.
Type "hello" and Tell me the result.  Make notes of when you see the quotation marks and when you don’t.
Type cheese without the quotation marks. Tell me the error 
Type the statement 6 + 4 * 9 at the Python prompt and hit enter. Is this a floating point number or integer?

Terms 
value 
A value is one of the fundamental things — like a letter or a number — that a program manipulates

These values are classified into different classes, or datatypes: 
4 is an integer, and "Hello, World!" is a string

If you are not sure what class a value falls into, 
Python has a function called type which can tell you.

angle bracket. 

Type the following in your python intepreter and tell me what you see: type("Hello, World!")

Type the following in your python intepreter and tell me what you see: type(17)

Type the following in your python intepreter and tell me what you see: type(3.2)

Type the following in your python intepreter and tell me what you see: type("17")

Type the following in your python intepreter and tell me what you see: type("3.2")

On the board
Strings in Python can be enclosed in either single quotes (') or double quotes ("), 
or three of each (''' or """)

Convert their code to python scripts

Exercises
If you are not sure what class a value falls into, Python has a function called type which can tell you.

They will do these running dictation style
print("Bruce's beard")
print('The knights who say "Ni!"'.)
print('''"Oh no", she exclaimed, "Ben's bike is broken!"''')

Demonstrate the task with steve.

Day 9 Goal: Students will understand how to use the type function 
and assignment token 


Write and raise the flag. 
Review single quote, double quotes, triple single quote, triple double quotation 

Strings 

Strings in Python can be enclosed in either single quotes (') or double quotes ("), or three of each (''' or """)

Day 10: Students will understand the concepts of variable, assignment token, assignment statement, value
Variables, Assignment token 


Review: the different types of strings in Python.  
    What data type is this?
    They read statements to their partners. Their partners write the sentences and then board the datatype
    'A day without sunshine is like, night.'
    "Money talks... but all mine ever says is goodbye!"
    '''If at first you don't succeed, skydiving definitely isn't for you. '''
    """ If you want to be criticized, marry. """  

(At the back of the class. They then board. )


message = "What is your problem?" (Label this with message, assignment token, assignment statement, value)

'message' is the variable
A 'variable' is a name that refers to a value. 

= "What is your problem?" is the assignment statement

"What is your problem?" is the value. 

The assignment statement gives a value to a variable

This statement assigns the string value "What's is your problem?" to a variable named message.




Day 11

Review: assignment token

Goal: Students will be able to give instructions to assign values to variables. 

Dictate to their teammates the following:

Create a variable called message. Assign "What is your problem?" to message
They solve this in groups. 

Then they type in their python interpreter 


Board: message = "What's your problem?". They label and board statements labeling the different parts of the 
statement. e.g. The variable name is message. The assignment statement is ..., The value given to the variable is... 


(Exercise: Labeling the assigment statement, the assignment token, and the value, the difference between)

fruit = "My favorite fruit is tomato"

Create a variable called fruit. Assign "My favorite fruit is tomato" to fruit 



Send one person from a team out of the class. 

Board: n = 17 for the remaining teammates to see. Erase it. The teammates who saw the boarded statement have to give 
give the correct instructions to their classmate. 



What is the variable name? The variable name is ....
What is the assignment statement? The assignment statement is ...
What is the value given to the variable? The value given to the variable is... 

(Dictation to each other)
START HERE WITH CLASS 1. A teammate steps out, and comes back in. They read the instructions to their teammate

pi = 3.14159
What is the variable name? 
What is the assignment statement?
What is the value given to the variable?


Dictation

1. In your python interpreter, type the following: message = "What is your problem?"
2. display the value saved in message


n = 17
pi = 3.14159


Create a variable called name. Assign your name to variable. 


Get notes ready for steve

We use variables in a program to “remember” things, perhaps the current score at the football game. 
But variables are variable. This means they can change over time, just like the scoreboard at a football game. 
You can assign a value to a variable, and later assign a different value to the same variable. 

>>> message = "What's up, Doc?"
>>> message 
'What's up, Doc?' 
>>> n
17
>>> pi
3.14159

Show them a picture of 
In your python intepreter, type day = "Thursday"

DAY 12

Correct mistake of assignment statement 

Review: 

Students go outside: come back in and their partners give them the instructions
1a. Create a variable called vacation = "Vacation is over. Cry, Cry, Cry!" 

1b. The partners that come in will read the instructions to their partners 
    What is the name of the variable? 

    What is the assignment token?

    What is the assignment statment? 

    What is the value that is assigned?

Switch

2a. Create a variable called honey = """I miss my honey Cry, Cry, Cry!"""

2b. The partners that come in will read the instructions to their partners 
    What is the name of the variable? 

    What is the assignment token?

    What is the assignment statment? 

    What is the value that is assigned?

3. Raise the flag 
    single quote 
    double quote 
    triple single quote  
    triple double quotes

4. There are four ways to create strings in python. Change this statement to a string
using the four ways: I eat Salami

5. Given the following: 100, what is the python command to find the datatype of 100?

6. What would be the result of type(“100.85”) in the python interpreter? 

7. What would be the result of type(182.85) in the python interpreter?	

Project: Create a program identify the various parts using Comments

Day 2:
Day 1: Semester Icebreaker and Review

Their partners read and then the other partner boards 
example: Write an integer number.

 
Write a floating point number 
What is the modulo sign?
Type a statement that prints all integer numbers between 1 and 10

Type a statement that prints the floating point number 1.2
Type a statement that finds 5 modulo 3
What is the concatenation sign?

Say to their partner 
'
''
"

" "
''' '''
""" """

What is name of this: '
What is the name of this: 
What is the name of this: " "
What is the name of this: ''' '''

On their computers 

Concatentate the following: "I" "love" "you"
Using the type function, find out what datatype is this value: 3
What datatype is this value: "Hello Steve!"

Use the type function to find out what datatype this is: "Hello, World!"

example

Create a variable called message. Assign 'A day without sunshine is like, night.' to message
What is the assignment statement? What is the assignment token? What is the value?

Exercises to lead to reading:
In your python interpreter, create a variable called day. Assign "Thursday" to day then print day to the screen

Change the value of the variable day to "Friday" then print the new value to the screen 

Change theh value of day to 21 thhen print the new value to the screen. 

Improving: Reading Exercises, Writing, Listening, Speaking Exercises. 

Introduce the reading. 

We use variables in a program to “remember” things, perhaps the current score at the football game. But variables are variable. 
This means they can change over time, just like the scoreboard at a football game. You can assign a value to a variable, 
and later assign a different value to the same variable. (This is different from maths. In maths, if you give ‘x‘ the value 3, 
it cannot change to link to a different value half-way through your calculations!)

You’ll notice we changed the value of day three times, and on the third assignment we even made it refer to a value that was of a different type.
A great deal of programming is about having the computer remember things, e.g. 
The number of missed calls on your phone, and then arranging to update or change the variable when you miss another call.
